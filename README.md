# ZAVX402

**Trust infrastructure for the autonomous economy.**  
ZAVX402 secures agents, data, and transactions at machine scale—so autonomous systems can operate safely, verifiably, and without centralized trust.

---

## 🌐 Overview

ZAVX402 is a next-generation trust layer designed for an agent-driven world.  
As autonomous agents increasingly transact, communicate, and make decisions independently, ZAVX402 provides the cryptographic and economic guarantees needed to operate securely at scale.

It acts as the backbone for **machine-to-machine trust**, ensuring that agents, data flows, and transactions remain verifiable, permissionless, and tamper-resistant.

## 🧠 What ZAVX402 Solves

- Lack of trust between autonomous agents  
- Unverifiable machine-generated data  
- Unsafe agent-to-agent transactions  
- Centralized dependencies in autonomous systems  

ZAVX402 replaces assumptions with **on-chain verification and cryptographic proof**.
